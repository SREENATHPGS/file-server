# file-server
A simple file server, you can upload media and document files here and get a sharable link that can be used to access uploaded files over the internet. This is more like google drive or dropbox, but created as a sub-project to be used along with post-scheduler (another project i'm working on). Encryptions and compression algorithms will be implemented soon.
